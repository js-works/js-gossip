// Vanilla-JS, framework-agnostic tracker for a popup anchored to a host
// element: decides which side (top/bottom) it renders on and how tall it can
// be, and keeps both live as the viewport changes — not just once when the
// popup opens, but continuously while it stays open (window resize, page
// scroll on any scrollable ancestor). Originally split out of
// ui-autocomplete's core; see its header comment for why this is
// measured-rects JS rather than CSS anchor positioning (position-try-order:
// most-height proved unreliable in real-world testing).
