// The three icons ui-date-field's trigger button uses, and the mapping from
// selection mode to glyph.
//
// Upstream had fourteen, one per mode (see temp/icons/register-icons.ts's
// `date-field.*` entries, resolved through a Shoelace icon library). They were
// ported and then cut back deliberately: at the size this button actually
// renders them — 1em, so 16px at the default scale — the only distinction that
// survives is shape-level, circle versus rounded square. The per-mode
// differences were all interior detail (a bar for a range, a dot row for a
// week, an "Aug" for a month, a block for a quarter) which turns to mush at
// 16px, so twelve of the fourteen read as the same calendar. They were also
// doing labelling work the field already does twice: it has a visible label and,
// once filled, a formatted value.
//
// What's left is the one thing worth signalling — what kind of popup opens: a
// calendar grid, or the time wheels.
//
// All three are Bootstrap Icons glyphs, filled, sized in em rather than px so
// they scale with the field's font-size.
