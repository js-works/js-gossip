         Sized from the widest thing the core actually produces, measured
         rather than guessed: with this element's border and the picker's own
         inset included, the month sheet with week numbers shown wants 311px and
         the time view 310px. 20.25 × the md font size (324px at the default
         scale) leaves 13px of headroom. Measured at the same width in all of
         en-US, en-GB, es-ES, fr-FR, de-DE, it-IT, ar-SA, hu-HU, pl-PL and
         zh-TW — the cells' own padding sets the width, not the weekday
         captions, so the locale doesn't move it. Anything narrower and the
         week-number column and the weekend highlight bleed out past the
         rounded border; much wider and the flex-grow cells simply spread,
         which undoes the sheet's density.

         Multiplied against --ui-font-size-md, NOT written as a plain \`em\`
         (which resolves against the *field's* font-size): the picker inside is
         not sized by this field at all — date-picker.styles.ts maps its
         --cal-font-size to --ui-font-size-md unconditionally — so its content
         is the same ~311px whatever \`size\` the field is. An em here made the
         card the one thing that tracked the field: size="small" gave a 283.5px
         card around 311px of calendar (the sheet hit its own
         min-width: 17.5em floor and the week-number column bled), and
         size="large" gave 364.5px, 54px of dead space with the cells spread
         thin. Both symptoms the paragraph above warns about, caused by the
         unit rather than the number. Still --ui-scale-tracking, since
         --ui-font-size-md is itself calc(1rem * var(--ui-scale)). */

    /* A small inset. The scale has no step between -sm (4px) and -md (16px) —
       16 was the original and read too airy, flush-to-the-edge too tight — so
       it's derived from -sm rather than written as a literal, and stays on the
       --ui-scale dial.

         still clears the buttons by more than this alone: the picker's own
