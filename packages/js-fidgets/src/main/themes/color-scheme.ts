 * built so every component follows `color-scheme` purely in CSS, via
 * `light-dark()`, with no script involved. This exists only for embedded
 * third-party widgets that do their theming in JavaScript and take a
 * light/dark prop of their own (BlockNote's `<BlockNoteView theme>` is the
 * one caller today), which therefore have to be told which scheme is active
 * and re-told when it changes.
 *
 * Reach for this only for that case. Anything styled by this library's own
 * CSS should stay declarative.

 * setting `documentElement.style.colorScheme` or toggling a class that a
