// `:root` alongside `:host` is inert wherever this only lives inside a shadow
// root (no shadow root has a root element), but lets a consumer also adopt
// this stylesheet at the top-level document to make these tokens available to
// plain light-DOM markup — see src/demo/demo.ts, which does exactly that so
// the demo page's own chrome tracks the same theme as the components it hosts.
//
// ## Light and dark
//
// Every color token below is a `light-dark()` pair, and the scheme is switched
// through the standard `color-scheme` property — never by overriding a token.
// That is forced by this file's own shape rather than being a style
// preference: this stylesheet is adopted into *every* component's shadow root,
// so the `:host` rule below declares each token directly on each component
// element, and a declaration on the element itself always beats a value
// inherited from an ancestor. A consumer writing `:root { --ui-bg: #111 }`
// would therefore be silently overridden by every component re-pinning its own
// default — the exact trap `--ui-scale` is kept out of the `:host` block to
// avoid (see its own comment at the bottom of this file). `light-dark()`
// sidesteps it by making each declaration self-contained: nothing has to reach
// in from outside, because both schemes' values are already here.
//
// `color-scheme` can be the switch precisely where a custom property can't,
// because it is a real inherited CSS property that this file only ever
// declares on `:root` (bottom of the file, alongside `--ui-scale` and for the
// same reason) — so it is never re-pinned per component and inherits through
// every shadow boundary from the document root. To follow the OS preference,
// do nothing; to force one scheme, set `color-scheme: light` or `dark` on
// `<html>` (src/demo/demo.ts's theme picker does exactly that, via an inline
// style, which outranks the `:root` rule here). A consumer who does *not*
// adopt this stylesheet at the document level leaves `color-scheme` at its
// initial `normal`, under which `light-dark()` resolves to its light argument
// — i.e. exactly the appearance this library had before dark mode existed.
//
// ## How the dark ramps are derived
//
// The dark half of each color ramp is the light ramp reversed end to end:
// each step pairs with the one the same distance from the other end of the
// ramp — 50↔950, 100↔900, 200↔800, 300↔700, 400↔600, and 500 with itself.
// (Positionally, not arithmetically: Tailwind's steps aren't evenly spaced,
// so the pairing follows the 11-entry list, not 950 minus the number.) That
// is what lets every existing component rule keep
// working in both schemes untouched — everywhere a component reads "one step
// up" to mean *more prominent* (a -500 fill hovering to -600, a -100 tint
// deepening to -200), the mirror preserves it, because -600 is darker than
// -500 against white and lighter than -500 against black. The -500 step is its
// own mirror, so accent fills are literally identical in both schemes.
//
// The mirror is not a perfect design job — Tailwind's ramps aren't
// lightness-symmetric, so a few dark accents come out slightly muddier than a
// hand-picked dark palette would be. It is deliberately a mechanical,
// auditable rule (every pair is visible on its own line) rather than a second
// palette to keep in sync.
